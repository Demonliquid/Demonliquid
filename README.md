# Welcome to my github!
Hi there, Martin here!. I am a backend dev from Cordoba, Argentina. I went from accounting, to data, to back. Currently I am under contract for Seenka but I stil try to do some freelancing or hobby project, there is always time for a little challenge. If you are intersted in some of my work feel free to contact me on gmail or linkedin.


### What do I want to do?
I would like to take on C++ and help on some Unreal Engine problem, but I want to improve my python as much as possiblem, it's a good programming language. Not a fan of JS or PHP. I can think about learning some Java or Golang.

### What did I do?
I try to upload what I can on these repos, but honestly it's too hard to keep looking for sensitive information or clean code if it's just for show. One of these is a lot of data cleaning for a car database and there is a lot of work outside github (db design for example), another is early staging of API integration, the rest are various one use cases.

## Who did I help?
### Seenka | 2021 - Now
- Integrated DSP's.
- Refactor old code.
- Maintain various Django API's.

### Freelance | 2019 - Now
- Scripting in general, example: Adobe Premiere bot.
- Scraping.
- web3

### Promotive | 2020-2021
- Data cleaning.
- MySQL design and implementation.

## Extras
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Django.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something related to geek culture.
